# Wakeful

Wakeful is a different kind of tech. Instead of distraction and dissatisfaction, we want something to inspire focus, relaxation and accomplishment.

Instead of fo-mo and mindless scrolling, something that helps us find our evolutionary path and the people that will help us along our journey.

To make a living and live our purpose at the same time. In order to do this we’re bringing ancient and contemporary technologies together.  

We believe this is how the next shift will happen...
